# LaunchCal :rocket:

View upcoming space launch missions around the world.

## About

LaunchCal grabs space launch data from [Launch Library](https://launchlibrary.net) and serves it to you in a beautiful way.

It uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/). I chose to use these technologies because they are both new _and_ exciting. Feathers makes creating REST APIs a breeze, and Nuxt allows me to tickle my love for Vue while using server side rendering.

## Getting Started

You can run LaunchCal on your own machine in a few simple steps.

1. Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed.

2. Install your dependencies.
```
yarn install
```

3. Start the app!
```
yarn run dev
```

4. Navigate to LaunchCal (http://localhost:3030)
